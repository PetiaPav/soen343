        As an Client, you may search the catalog for items and loan them if available. You can find the link to the catalog in the navigation bar as "Home". Clicking on that link will always take you to the Catalog.
        You are allowed to borrow at most 10 items at a time from the catalog. Books are due in a week, movies and music in 2 days and magazines are unfortunately unavailable.
